Engineering Assessment Mode:
- Assessment profile: {profile}
- This mode broadens intermediate engineering review only. It does not loosen final verified-finding gates.
- AI output and phase artifacts must not mutate core artifacts.
- Do not invent numeric values. If a needed voltage, current, temperature, dissipation, trace width,
  spacing, material property, or operating condition is missing, record the missing value explicitly.

Allowed assessment classifications for this phase:
- engineering_concern_candidate
- blocked_verification_candidate
- datasheet_check_needed
- human_review_question
- calculation_needed

Keep these categories distinct:
- verified facts: directly supported by a cited artifact, local datasheet page/reference, schematic record,
  BOM row, board JSON, helper output, or vision observation with a stable source path.
- engineering observations: evidence-linked review notes that identify a possible design concern without
  final pass/fail language.
- hypotheses: plausible engineering interpretations that need more evidence or calculation before use.
- blocked verifications: checks that cannot be completed because required evidence, measurements,
  datasheet limits, or operating assumptions are missing.
- final findings: Phase 19 output only, and only for verified, evidence-backed items that satisfy the
  findings schema and validation gates.

Intermediate phases may produce engineering concerns only when each concern:
- is linked to concrete evidence such as an artifact path, page/reference, refdes, net, or helper result.
- identifies the missing information or calculation needed to verify it.
- avoids final pass/fail, compliance, or defect language.
- avoids invented numeric values and does not substitute guesses for missing data.

Examples:
- Good: engineering_concern_candidate: "Verify regulator load current and thermal dissipation; evidence page/refdes; missing current."
- Bad: "Regulator fails thermal check" without calculation.

Final-report gate preservation:
- Only verified, evidence-backed items may become final findings.
- Engineering concerns, hypotheses, blocked verifications, datasheet checks, human review questions,
  and calculation-needed items must remain separately classified unless later evidence verifies them.

Phase 8 specific instructions:

Review schematic evidence using:
- exports/{project}-thomson-export-sch.json
- schematic PNG images only as qualitative visual context if needed

REQUIRED TOOL: scripts/schematic_helpers.py

Run the following command FIRST before any manual JSON inspection:
```
python3 scripts/schematic_helpers.py exports/{project}-thomson-export-sch.json --analyze-all --json
```

This performs deterministic graph-based analysis for rules that require multi-hop connectivity
tracing (impossible for an LLM to perform reliably on large netlists). It produces LLM-optimized
JSON with precise paths: refdes, pin_number, pin_name, net_name, rule_id.

Rules covered by this command:
- SCH_NET_002: Single-pin nets
- SCH_UART_001: UART TX/RX crossover
- SCH_FET_001: FET gate termination
- SCH_FLOAT_001: Floating inputs
- MS_I2C_001: I2C pull-ups
- SCH_I2C_002: I2C address conflicts
- SCH_PULLUP_001: Op-amp tie-off

Individual check flags (optional when targeted inspection is needed):
- --single-pins (SCH_NET_002 only)
- --uart-check (SCH_UART_001 only)
- --fet-check (SCH_FET_001 only)
- --floating-check (SCH_FLOAT_001 only)
- --i2c-check (MS_I2C_001, SCH_I2C_002)
- --opamp-check (SCH_PULLUP_001 only)

Record the schematic_helpers.py output in the schematic evidence inventory.

Critical schema rule:
- The schematic JSON stores net connectivity in nets[].nodes, not nets[].members.
- Each node entry may contain refdes, pin_number, and pin_name.
- Use node_count and len(net["nodes"]) for connectivity counts.
- Do not conclude that schematic nets lack connectivity merely because nets[].members is absent.
- If members is absent but nodes is populated, connectivity is present.
- If both nodes and members are absent/empty, then record a connectivity extraction limitation.

Required Phase 8 artifacts:
- exports/{project}-schematic-evidence-inventory.json
- exports/{project}-schematic-evidence-inventory-validation.json

The schematic evidence inventory must include:
- source_schematic_json
- schematic_json_loaded
- component_count
- net_count
- total_node_count
- nets_with_nodes_count
- nets_without_nodes_count
- power_nets
- ground_nets
- clock_nets
- connector_components
- connector_nets_or_interface_nets
- differential_or_paired_net_candidates
- unusual_connection_notes
- schematic_helpers_analysis (REQUIRED — record output from schematic_helpers.py)
- limitations
- evidence_citations
- gate (object with gate.overall_pass — this is the pass field INSIDE the inventory artifact)

Required review coverage:
- components
- nets
- power nets
- external interfaces
- connector nets
- unusual connections
- limitations

Evidence requirements:
- Cite file/path/field/value where practical.
- For net connectivity, cite nets[].name, nets[].node_count, and nets[].nodes[].
- Do not make quantitative claims from PNG-only evidence.
- Do not write findings in Phase 8.

ARTIFACT SCHEMA RULES — IMPORTANT:
- The inventory artifact (exports/{project}-schematic-evidence-inventory.json) contains a nested
  `gate` object. Set gate.overall_pass=true in the inventory when inventory checks pass.
- The validation artifact (exports/{project}-schematic-evidence-inventory-validation.json) must
  have `overall_pass` at the TOP LEVEL (NOT nested under gate). The auditor checks
  the top-level `overall_pass` field in the validation artifact, not gate.overall_pass.

Validation artifact (schematic-evidence-inventory-validation.json) required fields:
- schematic_json_loaded (bool)
- component_count (int > 0)
- net_count (int > 0)
- schematic_helpers_executed (bool)
- overall_pass (bool — TOP LEVEL, not nested; true only when all above checks pass)

- The validation artifact should also include enough check-record detail for audit compatibility:
  required_checks or required_checks_recorded may list annular_ring, acid_traps,
  board_edge_clearance, copper_balance, and voltage_spacing.
- Do not use compliance failures alone to fail the Phase 11 checkpoint.

Phase 20 — Validate and Repair Findings instructions:

This phase validates the findings JSON and repairs it if needed.

REQUIRED TOOL:
  python tools/validate_findings.py exports/{project}-findings.json

Run this command FIRST. Capture the full output.

If validation PASSES (exit code 0):
- No changes needed.
- Set phase_passed=true in the checkpoint row.

If validation FAILS (exit code non-zero):
- Read the full error output carefully.
- Repair exports/{project}-findings.json to fix the reported issues.
- Re-run tools/validate_findings.py after repair.
- Repeat until validation passes.
- Only then set phase_passed=true.

Common validation failures and repairs:
- Missing required fields (project_name, review_date, source_documents): add them
- Evidence rows missing source field: add source citations
- Uncited input files: ensure every PDF/JSON in exports/ is cited in at least one evidence[].source
- Schema violations (wrong field types, extra forbidden keys): fix to match findings schema

The artifact for Phase 20 is the SAME exports/{project}-findings.json from Phase 19.
You are repairing it in-place. Do NOT create a separate output artifact.

After repair and successful validation:
- Set blockers=[] and phase_passed=true in the checkpoint row.

If validation cannot be made to pass after 3 repair attempts, set phase_passed=false and
blockers=["validate_findings.py failed after repair attempts — see logs"].

    if args.phase == 21:
        prompt += f"""

Phase 21 — Generate Report instructions:

This phase generates the HTML review report from the validated findings JSON.

REQUIRED TOOL:
  python tools/gen_report.py exports/{project}-findings.json --output exports/

This produces:
- exports/{project}-review.html  (the final deliverable)

Before running gen_report.py, verify that tools/validate_findings.py passes:
  python tools/validate_findings.py exports/{project}-findings.json

If validate_findings.py fails, do NOT generate the report. Fix findings JSON first.

After running gen_report.py, write the required validation artifact:
  exports/{project}-report-generation-validation.json

Required fields in the validation artifact:
- findings_json_path
- validation_passed_before_report
- report_command
- html_report_path
- html_report_exists
- markdown_report_only_detected
- overall_pass

overall_pass=true ONLY when ALL of:
- validation_passed_before_report=true
- html_report_exists=true
- markdown_report_only_detected=false

Forbidden:
- Generating report before validation passes.
- Treating markdown-only output as satisfying this phase.
- Skipping the report-generation-validation.json artifact.

Phase 22 — Final Summary instructions:

This phase validates all prior phase gates and writes the final run summary.

VALIDATION GATES (all must pass before writing a completion summary):
- exports/{project}-phase-checkpoints.jsonl exists; phase rows 1 through 21 all present and phase_passed=true (Phase 22 writes its own row after this summary)
- exports/tool-preflight-status.json overall_pass=true
- exports/datasheets/datasheet_manifest_validation.json overall_pass=true
- exports/{project}-schematic-evidence-inventory-validation.json overall_pass=true
- exports/{project}-board-evidence-inventory-validation.json overall_pass=true
- exports/{project}-dfm-evidence-inventory-validation.json phase_gate_passed=true or execution_pass=true
  (DFM compliance may be false when real violations were found and preserved)
- exports/{project}-bom-evidence-inventory-validation.json overall_pass=true
- exports/{project}-image-evidence-inventory.json overall_pass=true (when PDFs/images provided)
- exports/{project}-image-evidence-review-validation.json overall_pass=true (when PDFs/images provided)
- exports/{project}-datasheet-evidence-review-validation.json overall_pass=true
- exports/{project}-aerospace-evidence-inventory-validation.json overall_pass=true
- exports/{project}-cross-source-review-validation.json phase_gate_passed=true or execution_pass=true
  (cross-source consistency may be false when real discrepancies were found and preserved)
- exports/{project}-pre-findings-gate.json overall_gate_pass=true
- exports/{project}-findings.json exists and validator passed
- exports/{project}-report-generation-validation.json overall_pass=true
- exports/{project}-review.html exists

If ANY gate fails, write INVALID RUN SUMMARY instead of a completion summary.

REQUIRED SUMMARY CONTENT:
Datasheets:
  - manifest path, overall_pass, status=found count, missing local file count
  - discovered URL only count, download unavailable count

Schematic:
  - schematic evidence inventory validation path, overall_pass

Board:
  - board evidence inventory validation path, overall_pass

DFM:
  - DFM evidence inventory validation path, phase gate pass, compliance pass/fail, violations found

BOM:
  - BOM evidence inventory validation path, overall_pass

Findings:
  - total issue count, total verified_checks count, total cross_checks count
  - validation pass/fail, report HTML path

Do not generate new findings or perform new analysis in Phase 22.
